      <h2>The Knights of The Round Table</h2>
      <p>Whenever King Arthur is mentioned, his Knights of the Round Table are not far behind. Along with Excalibur and Avalon, the Knights are a pillar of Arthurian Legend, each of them holding a story that are time even more fantastical than the King's stories. Due to history of Briton and how different folklore mixed into creating a singular myth, some Knights can be traced back into different origins before before being a part of Camelot. Historically, there are hundreds of members of the Round Table, but this Table focuses on the most well known retainers.   </p>

                  <td>It has been said that Lancelot was the greatest fighter and swordsman of all the Knights of the Round Table, and yet he was also extremely intelligent and known for his charm and humor. Legend tells us that as a child, Lancelot was left by the shore of The Lake, where he was found by Vivien, the Lady of the Lake. Caring for him as her own, Vivien fostered and raised Lancelot, raising one of history’s greatest knights.</td>
                  <td>Though Lancelot is often referred to as the greatest knight, Gawain is also referred to as the greatest knight of the Round Table on occasion and is most recognized from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It seemed to be common knowledge that Sir Gawain was also the most trusted friend of Sir Lancelot and in some legends he seems to be the rightful heir to the throne of Camelot once King Arthur passes.</td>
                  <td>On one occasion a “sword in a stone” was seen in a river by King Arthur’s knights and legend stated that only the world’s best knight could pull out the sword. Galahad was led into King Arthur’s court where he sat in the Siege Perilous (the vacant seat at the Round Table reserved for the Knight who would one day be successful at recovering the Holy Grail).</td>
                  <td>A truly deep and fervent supporter of King Arthur from the very start, Sir Bedivere never waned from that support. Bedivere was also one of the first knights to join the fellowship of the Round Table, and was by King Arthur’s side at his death/transport to the Isle of Avalon. Sir Bedivere also helped King Arthur fight the Giant of Mont St. Michel and later was made Duke of Neustria.</td>
                  <td>Sir Tristan became the champion of his uncle upon defeating and killing Marhaus of Ireland in a duel. That defeat led to a truce with King Anguish of Ireland who arranged for his daughter, Iseult to be married to King Mark. Sir Tristan who was sent to Ireland to fetch the would be Queen, but while in the process of bringing her back to Cornwall, Tristan and Iseult fell hopelessly in love with one another. Upon realizing there was no hope for them to stay together and live a normal life, they fled from King Mark and lived the rest of their days on the run.</td>
                  <td>Touted as being one of the most handsome knights of the Round Table, Sir Agravain was also a skilled fighter and strategist. Legend has it, that in the earliest of texts Agravain may have had a not so perfect reputation, but in later manuscripts he’s referred to as noble and chivalrous. In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Agravaine is mentioned as Agravain of the Hard Hand.</td>
                  <td>The incest and bastard son of King Arthur and Morgan Le Fay,Mordred trained for all his life in order to surpass his father. He became a close companion to Lancelot. When King Arthur had to leave his kingdom to fight Lancelot and his rebellion, Mordred took the opportunity to take Camelot undefended which led to King Arthur killing him in the battle of Camlann. </td>
