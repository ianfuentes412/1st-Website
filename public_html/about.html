            <h2> About Us </h2>
            <p> My first exposure to King Arthur was through the show "Fate/Stay Night" which depicted King Arthur pitted against other legends and figures in history. One of my favorite scenes in the show is when rulers from different time periods came to one table to argue who is the best ruler. Seeing Arthur argue for his case as the greatest king made me curious about the question, "What does it mean to lead?" 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> I started looking at different works about the story of King Arthur to know more about why he was known as the King of Knights and from there I was immersed in the stories of the Legends of Briton. From the "Sword in the Stone" to the "Battle of Camlann" they painted a picture on what it was like to be honorable and masculine in that era.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The most interesting aspect of legends and stories for me are the retellings by different people. King Arthur's main theme endure but there are multiple accounts and retelling from different eras and places in Briton, and they serve as an interesting reflection to what people valued back then. Because of this I am most interested about how the story is treated in today's culture and today's values.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Really I used this assignment as an way to justify reading fairy tales as an adult.</p>
